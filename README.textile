h2. Installation

bq. ./build.sh

_*Note* the current bleeding edge version of Node.js has been having trouble on some systems. To get around this, you can install it from a tarball_

bq. wget http://nodejs.org/dist/node-v0.1.93.tar.gz

bq. tar -xvf node-v0.1.93.tar.gz

bq. cd node-v0.1.9

bq. ./configure

bq. make

bq. install

At this point you should have a working copy of Mobius-JS and its dependent libraries.
